I'm thrilled to be a part of [@47deg](https://github.com/47deg) as a Software Engineer, bringing with me a wealth of knowledge gained through my Ph.D. in Computer Engineering from the [University of Cadiz](https://www.uca.es/). My journey so far has been an exciting mix of research, teaching, and industry training.

During my time at the University of Cadiz, I had the opportunity to delve into cutting-edge research as both a postdoctoral and predoctoral researcher. Alongside this, I enjoyed teaching Front-End and Back-End coding to bright and enthusiastic students pursuing their Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering. Witnessing their growth and helping them navigate the world of coding was truly fulfilling.

In my current role, I'm delving into the fascinating world of Functional Programming and back-end engineering, focusing on Scala. I'm diving deep into the Typelevel ecosystem, working with exciting technologies like Cats Effects, Doobie, fs2, and http4s. Additionally, I'm making use of powerful cloud solutions such as S3, Kinesis, and SES to build scalable and efficient systems.

I've also gained hands-on experience in deployment and DevOps, using tools like Kubernetes with Helm to manage and orchestrate complex infrastructures. I've also used tools like OpenTelemetry and Jaeger to gain valuable insights into system performance.

With my strong academic foundation, practical experience, and unwavering passion for the latest technologies, I'm excited to contribute my skills to the innovative projects at [@47deg](https://github.com/47deg) and help drive their success.
